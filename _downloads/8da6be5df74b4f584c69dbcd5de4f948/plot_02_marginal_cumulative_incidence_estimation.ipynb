        "\n# Estimating marginal cumulative incidence functions\n\nThis example demonstrates how to estimate the marginal cumulative incidence\nusing :class:`hazardous.SurvivalBoost` and compares the results to the\nAalen-Johansen estimator and to the theoretical cumulated incidence curves on\nsynthetic data.\n\nHere the data is generated by taking the minimum time of samples from three\ncompeting Weibull distributions with fixed parameters and without any\nconditioning covariate. In this case, the Aalen-Johansen estimator is expected\nto be unbiased, and this is empirically confirmed by this example.\n\nThe :class:`hazardous.SurvivalBoost` estimator on the other hand is a\npredictive estimator that expects at least one conditioning covariate. In this\nexample, we use a dummy covariate that is constant for all samples. Here we are\nnot interested in the discrimination power of the estimator: there is none by\nconstruction, since we do not have access to informative covariates. Instead we\nempirically study its marginal calibration, that is, its ability to\napproximately recover an unbiased estimate of the marginal cumulative incidence\nfunction for each competing event.\n\nThis example also highlights that :class:`hazardous.SurvivalBoost` estimates\nnoisy cumulative incidence functions, which are not smooth and not even\nmonotonically increasing. This is a known limitation of the estimator, and\nattempting to enforce monotonicity at training time typically introduces severe\nover-estimation bias for large time horizons.\n"
