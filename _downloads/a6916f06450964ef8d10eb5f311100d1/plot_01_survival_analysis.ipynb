This\nis the processed data set used in the\n[DeepSurv paper (Katzman et al. 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1).\n"

It is comprised between 0 and 1 (higher is better),\n  with 0.5 corresponding to random predictions.\n\nAdditionnaly, we compute the\n:func:`Integrated Brier Score <hazardous.metrics.integrated_brier_score_survival>`\n(IBS), which we will use to summarize the Brier score in time:\n\n\n"
