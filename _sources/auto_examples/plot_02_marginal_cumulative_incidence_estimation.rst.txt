==================================================
Estimating marginal cumulative incidence functions
==================================================

This example demonstrates how to estimate the marginal cumulative incidence
using :class:`hazardous.SurvivalBoost` and compares the results to the
Aalen-Johansen estimator and to the theoretical cumulated incidence curves on
synthetic data.

Here the data is generated by taking the minimum time of samples from three
competing Weibull distributions with fixed parameters and without any
conditioning covariate. In this case, the Aalen-Johansen estimator is expected
to be unbiased, and this is empirically confirmed by this example.

The :class:`hazardous.SurvivalBoost` estimator on the other hand is a
predictive estimator that expects at least one conditioning covariate. In this
example, we use a dummy covariate that is constant for all samples. Here we are
not interested in the discrimination power of the estimator: there is none by
construction, since we do not have access to informative covariates. Instead we
empirically study its marginal calibration, that is, its ability to
approximately recover an unbiased estimate of the marginal cumulative incidence
function for each competing event.

This example also highlights that :class:`hazardous.SurvivalBoost` estimates
noisy cumulative incidence functions, which are not smooth and not even
monotonically increasing. This is a known limitation of the estimator, and
attempting to enforce monotonicity at training time typically introduces severe
over-estimation bias for large time horizons.

Since we know the true distribution of the data, we can compute the
theoretical cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) by integrating the hazard
functions. The CIFs are the probability of experiencing the event of interest
before time t, given that the subject has not experienced any other event
before time t.

The following function computes the hazard function of a `Weibull
distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution>`_:

        #
        # XXX: this does not seem correct but in practice it does make it possible
        # to integrate the hazard function into cumulative incidence functions in a

Note that true CIFs are independent of the censoring distribution. We can use
them as reference to check that the estimators are unbiased by the censoring.

We first define the two estimators of interest. The
:class:`hazardous.SurvivalBoost` instance uses the Kaplan-Meier estimator on
the negated event labels (1 for censoring, 0 for any event) to estimate
internal IPCW weights. This is a valid choice in this context because we do
not have access to any informative covariate (either for censoring or for the
events of interest).

CIFs estimated on censored data
-------------------------------

Add some independent censoring with some arbitrary parameters to control the
amount of censoring: lowering the expected value bound increases the amount
of censoring.

Note that the Aalen-Johansen estimator is unbiased and empirically recovers
the theoretical curves both with and without censoring. The
SurvivalBoost estimator also appears unbiased by censoring, but
the predicted curves are not smooth and not even monotonically increasing. By
adjusting the hyper-parameters, notably the learning rate, the number of
boosting iterations and leaf nodes, it is possible to somewhat control the
smoothness of the predicted curves, but it is likely that doing some kind of
smoothing post-processing could be beneficial (but maybe at the cost of
introducing some bias). This is left as future work.

Alternatively, we could try to enable a monotonicity constraint at training
time, however, in practice this often causes a sever over-estimation bias for
the large time horizons:
