class WeightedBinaryTargetSampler(IncidenceScoreComputer):
    """Weighted binary targets for censoring-adjusted incidence estimation.

    Cast a cumulative incidence estimation problem with censored event times as
    a binary classification problem with weighted targets.

    This class samples time-horizons uniformly, and for each event (censored or
    not) and each time horizon, computes for each of the the IPCW weights and
    the expected binary targets. By optimizing the stochastic average of a
    proper-scoring rule such as the time-dependent Brier score or binary
    cross-entropy, we obtain an estimator of the cumulative incidence function
    that minimizes the time-integrated Brier Score (IBS) or time-integrated
    Negative Log Likelihood (INLL).

class GradientBoostingIncidence(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    r"""Cause-specific Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) with GBDT.

    In competing risk analysis, one wants to predict each cause-specific
    Cumulative Incidence Function that is to say:

    .. math::

        \hat{F}_k(t) \approx \mathbb{P}(T \leq t, E=k)
    where :math:`T` is a random variable for the uncensored time to first event
    and :math:`E` is a random variable over the :math:`[1, K]` domain for the
    uncensored event type.
    One can obtain the survival probability of any event by computing
    each CIF (that is to say running the model for each cause-specific CIF)
    and computing 1 - ‚Äúsum of CIF curves‚Äù because:

    .. math::

        S(t) = \mathbb{P}(T > t) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T \leq t)
        = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^K \mathbb{P}(T \leq t, E=k)
        \approx 1 - \sum_{k=1}^K \hat{F}_k(t)

    Note that this is equivalent in expectation to running the model once
    for the collapsed `event_of_intercept="any"` formulation.

    This internally relies on the histogram-based gradient boosting classifier
    or regressor implementation of scikit-learn.

    Estimate a cause-specific CIF by iteratively minimizing a stochastic time
    integrated proper scoring rule (Brier score or binary cross-entropy) for
    the kth cause of failure as defined in equation 14 in [Kretowska2018]_.

    Under the hood, this class uses randomly sampled reference time horizons
    concatenated as an extra input column to the underlying HGB binary
    classification model. At boosting iteration, a new tree is trained on a
    copy of the original feature matrix X augmented with a new independent sample
    of time horizons.

    One can obtain the survival probabilities for any event by summing all
    cause-specific CIF curves and computing 1 - "sum of CIF curves".

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_of_interest : int or "any", default="any"
        The event to compute the CIF for. When passed as an integer, it should
        match one of the values observed in `y_train["event"]`. Note: 0 always
        represents censoring and cannot be used as a valid event of interest.

        "any" means that all events are collapsed together and the resulting
        model can be used for any event survival analysis: the any event
        survival function can be estimated as the complement of the any event
        cumulative incidence function.

        In single event settings, "any" and 1 are equivalent.

    loss : {'ibs', 'inll'}, default='ibs'
        The objective of the model. In practice, both objectives yield
        comparable results.

        - 'ibs' : integrated brier score. Use a `HistGradientBoostedRegressor`
          with the 'squared_error' loss. As we have no guarantee that the
          regression yields a survival function belonging to [0, 1], we clip
          the probabilities to this range.
        - 'inll' : integrated negative log likelihood (also known as integrated
          binary cross-entropy). Use a `HistGradientBoostedClassifier` with
          'log_loss'.

    time_horizon : float or int, default=None
        A specific time horizon `t_horizon` to treat the model as a
        probabilistic classifier to estimate ``ùîº[T < t_horizon, E = k|X]`` where
        ``T`` is a random variable representing the (uncensored) event and ``E``
        a random categorical variable representing the (uncensored) event type.

        When specified, the ``predict_proba`` method returns an estimate of
        ``ùîº[T < t_horizon, E = k|X]`` for each provided realization of ``X``.

    monotonic_incidence : str or False, default=False
        Whether to constrain the CIF to be monotonic with respect to time.
        If left to `False`, the CIF is not constrained to be monotonic and
        can randomly oscillate around the true CIF.

        If set to 'at_training_time', the CIF is constrained to be monotonically
        increasing at training time.

        TODO: implement 'at_prediction_time' option with isotonic regression.

        Note: constraining the CIF to be monotonic can lead to a biased estimate
        of the CIF: the CIF is typically overestimated for the longest time
        horizons, especially for large number of boosting iterations and deep
        trees.

    The remaining hyper-parameters match those of the underlying
    `HistGradientBoostedClassifier` or `HistGradientBoostedRegressor` models.
