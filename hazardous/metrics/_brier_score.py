    y_train : record-array, dictionnary or dataframe of shape (n_samples, 2)
        The target, consisting in the 'event' and 'duration' columns.
        This is used to fit the IPCW estimator.

    y_test : record-array, dictionnary or dataframe of shape (n_samples, 2)
        The ground truth, consisting in the 'event' and 'duration' columns.
        In the "event" column, `0` indicates censoring, and any other values
        indicate competing event types.

    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_times)
        Incidence probability estimates predicted at ``times``.
        In the binary event settings, this is 1 - survival_probability.

    times : array-like of shape (n_times)
        Times at which the survival probabilities ``y_pred`` has been estimated
        and for which we compute the Brier score.

    event_of_interest : int or "any", default="any"
        The event to consider in a competing events setting. When an integer,
        this should be one of the non-zero values in the "event" column of
        ``y_train`` and ``y_test``.

        ``"any"`` indicates that all events except the censoring marker ``0``
        are considered collapsed together as a single event. In a single event
        setting, ``"any"`` and ``1`` are equivalent.
