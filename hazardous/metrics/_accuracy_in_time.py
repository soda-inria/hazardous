    r"""Accuracy in time for prognostic models using competing risks.

    .. math::

        \mathrm{acc}(\zeta) = \frac{1}{n_{nc}} \sum_{i=1}^n ~ I\{\hat{y}_i=y_{i,\zeta}\}
        \overline{I\{\delta_i = 0 \cap t_i \leq \zeta \}}

    where:

    - :math:`I` is the indicator function.
    - :math:`\zeta` is a fixed time horizon.
    - :math:`n_{nc}` is the number of uncensored individuals at :math:`\zeta`.
    - :math:`\delta_i` is the event experienced by the individual :math:`i` at
      :math:`t_i`.
    - :math:`\hat{y} = \text{arg}\max\limits_{k \in [0, K]} \hat{F}_k(\zeta|X=x_i)`
      where :math:`\hat{F}_0(\zeta|X=x_i) \triangleq \hat{S}(\zeta|X=x_i)`.

      :math:`\hat{y}` is the most probable predicted event for individual :math:`i`
      at :math:`\zeta`.
    - :math:`y_{i,\zeta} = \delta_i ~ I\{t_i \leq \zeta \}` is the observed event
      for individual :math:`i` at :math:`\zeta`.

    The accuracy in time is a metric introduced in [Alberge2024]_ which evaluates
    whether observed events are predicted as the most likely at given times.
    This metric measures if the highest predicted event (one of the event of interest
    or the survival one) corresponds to the one observed at :math:`\zeta` for each
    patient.

    We remove individuals that were censored at times :math:`t \leq \zeta`, so the
    accuracy in time essentially represents the accuracy of the estimator on
    observed events up to :math:`\zeta`.

    At the start, every model's accuracy will be high because it will predict
    that patients have survived, which will be true in most cases. However, the
    true measure of the model's discriminative power emerges at later time points,
    when it must determine which specific event will occur for a given patient.

    The C-index depends on other individual in the cohort, while the accuracy-in-time
    for an individual does not. Conceptually, the C-index can help clinicians to
    priorize treatment allocation by ranking individuals by risk of a given event of
    interest. The accuracy in time, however, answers a different question: "`what is
    the most likely event that this individual will experience at some fixed time
    horizon?`". Therefore, the accuracy in time helps clinicians choose the right
    treatment by priorizing the risk for a given individual.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_test : array, dict or dataframe of shape (n_samples, 2)
        The test target, consisting in the 'event' and 'duration' columns

    y_pred : array of shape (n_samples, n_events, n_time_grid)
        Cumulative incidence for all competing events, at the time points
        from the input time_grid.

    time_grid : array of shape (n_time_grid,)
        Time points used to predict the cumulative incidence.

    quantiles : array_like of shape (n_taus,), default=None
        The fixed time horizons to compute the accuracy in time, defined as quantiles
        of ``time_grid``. Taus values are deduplicated. When no quantiles are
        passed, taus is the time_grid.

    Returns
    -------
    acc_in_time : array of shape (n_taus)
        The accuracy in time computed at the fixed horizons ``taus``.

    taus : array of shape (n_taus)
        The fixed time horizons effectively used to compute the accuracy in time.
