In this notebook, we showcase how the accuracy in time metric behaves, and how
to interpret it.

# -------

# We display the accuracy in time to compare Survival Boost with Aalen-Johansen.
# Higher is better. Note that the accuracy is high at very beginning (t < 1000), because
# both models predict that every individual survive.
# Then, beyond the time horizon 1000, the discriminative power of the conditional
# Survival Boost yields a better accuracy than the marginal, unbiased, Aalen-Johansen.

# Understanding the accuracy in time

# We can drill into this metric by counting the observed events cumulatively across
# time, and compare that to predictions.
#
# We display below the distribution of ground truth labels. Each color bar group
# represents the event distribution at some given horizon.
# Almost no individual have experienced an event at the very beginning.
# Then, as time passes by, events occur and the number of censored individual at each
# time horizon shrinks. Therefore, the very last distribution represents the overall
# event distribution of the dataset.
