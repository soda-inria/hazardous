Gradient-boosting survival analysis
-----------------------------------

.. container:: index-features

   * survival and competing risks

   * scikit-learn compatible

   * scalable gradient boosting

A scalable **time-to-event and competing risk prediction model**
implemented in Python.

.. container:: index-box sd-card

   **Competing risks settings**

   Predicting which event will happen first, and when, from data where some
   events have not yet been observed:

   .. image:: competing_risk_diagram.svg

The model is **a gradient-boosting variant**, that offers prediction for
survival and competing risks settings, fully compatible with
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_. It can be used with
scikit-learn tools such as pipelines, column transformers,
cross-validation, hyper-parameter search tools, etc.

.. This package will also offer neural network based estimators by leveraging
   `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ and `skorch
   <https://skorch.readthedocs.io/>`_.

This library puts a focus on predictive accuracy rather than on inference.
Quantifying the statistical association or causal effect of covariates with/on
the cumulated event incidence or instantaneous hazard rate is not in the scope
of this library at this time.

The theory behind the model is described in `this paper
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14085>`_.
